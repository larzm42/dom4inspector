Deep Seers are human mages favored by the Kings of the Deep. Once initiated in the mysteries of the deep in a coastal city, the Seer has advanced through the ranks of the cult and become a prominent Witness of the Deep, a sacred leader of the coastal mystery cult of the deep. As a Witness, the Seer was given further training in the fabled Coral Towers to become a powerful wielder of Water magic and divination. The Deep Seers are rarely seen outside the Coral Towers, but they sometimes travel to new-founded colonies to visit the local cult and inspire its members. Deep Seers are blessed by the Coral Queens and are given priestly authority over their human kin.
