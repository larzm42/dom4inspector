Since the first contacts with Therodos the mermen of Pelagia have been fascinated with the secrets of the Closed Realm, the Pelagian name for dry land. Explorers of the closed realm arrived with remarkable secrets and hidden lore. With time mystics initiated priests and soldiers in the secrets of the closed realm. A religious order formed, bent on spreading the glory of the awakening god into the closed realm. At first several Closed Realm shrines were founded, but suspicion among the Pearl Mages of an impending mermen rebellion resulted in a decree that the shrines of the Closed Realm were to close. To keep possible enemies close the Champions of the Closed Realm were given status and influence at the Palace of Pearls and training of the Champions was restricted to the palace grounds. The Champions of the Closed Realm uses iron weapons and other secrets of the Closed Realm, and are not expected to fight in the sea.
