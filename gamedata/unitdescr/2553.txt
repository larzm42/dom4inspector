The Ahuras were three celestial beings given might and splendor by a previous Pantokrator. The Ahura of the Oath was given the Flame of Truth and was tasked with upholding any oath sworn in the name of the Pantokrator. Now with the Pantokrator gone, he will make the whole world swear him fealty. The Ahura of the Oath still wields the Sword of Oaths and the cleansing flame of the Everburning Fire.
