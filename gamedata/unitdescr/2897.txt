The Kernou was a small Marverni tribe that fell under the sway of the Tuatha of Tir na n'Og. When the city of Bronze and Crystal rose to power the inhabitants of Kernou became ever more dependent on the gifts of the Tuatha. When Tir na n'Og fell and Ker-Ys vanished beneath the waves the Kernou tribe succumbed to Marverni rule and lost much of the lore and riches once bestowed upon them by the Tuatha. But Marverni also succumbed to greater powers, and the remaining Kerou tribesmen survived long enough to witness the reemergence of Ker-Ys. The former servants of the Tuatha now flock to the call of the Morgen, ready to receive their blessing anew. Kernou Warriors fight and arm themselves like they did in Marverni times, but warriors never fight bare chested and the nobles of the tribe use heavy mail hauberks.
