The Hooded Spirit is a spirit of fertility and growth. It was given the divine spark by a goddess of a sacred spring and served her faithfully until the previous Pantokrator rose to power. When the Pantokrator banished all gods the Hooded Spirit was spared and was tasked with bringing fertility and prosperity to all mankind. But the spirit was seduced by men and sired offspring with divine sparks. The Pantokrator was furious and banished his servant for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the hooded spirit is once more able to enter the world and bring fertility to the land. The Hooded spirit is not bound by laws of proximity and is able to manifest itself all over creation.
