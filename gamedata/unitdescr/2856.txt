The Son of the Sea is an ancient demigod sprung from the Sea. Once the servant of the previous Pantokrator he became the psychopomp of the watery dead. He would take the newly dead on his boat 'Wave Sweeper' to the Land of the Watery Dead, where they would live on in the gloomy halls underneath the stormy seas. When the Fomorians rebelled against the Pantokrator and ravaged the world, the Son of the Sea was punished for having given them the means to escape their prison land. The Son of the Sea was imprisoned for millennia, but with the Pantokrator gone, his shackles are weakening and he is ready to enter the world of the living as God and ruler of all. The Son of the Sea is strongly attuned to the sea and the storms, but his task of guiding the souls of the dead has given him great powers over the dead. He is a master of trickery and illusions and can hide his true appearance. With his ship, 'Wave Sweeper', he can bring his followers across the sea, or he can bless them with water-breathing.
