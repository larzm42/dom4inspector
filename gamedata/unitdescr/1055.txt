A siren is a highly magical being capable of changing shape. While under water, she appears as a beautiful woman with the tail of a fish. When she leaves the sea, she takes the form of a gull with the head and torso of a woman. Sirens are gifted with an enchanting voice and can lure men into the sea with their songs. While hiding in a coastal province, a siren can attempt to lure commanders to a watery grave. Sirens are mages of Water and Air. While under water, they lose their Air magic skills, but gain skill in Water magic.
