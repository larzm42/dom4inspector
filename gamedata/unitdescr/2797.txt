Born at the dawn of time the Hieracosphinx represents an earlier era, when monsters and giants roamed the world. It has the body of a lion with the head and wings of a great falcon. It was given divine might and authority by a previous Pantokrator and served as a guardian spirit of the realms and kingdoms under the sun. Now with the Pantokrator gone it has realized the aspirations of the other Pretenders and will protect its subjects by donning the mantle of God itself. The Hieracosphinx is attuned to the powers of the sky and the sun.
