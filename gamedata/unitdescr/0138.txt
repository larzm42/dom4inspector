The Gorgon is a female beast of horrific appearance. Her hair is a mass of snakes and her eyes burn with amber fire. Great flapping bat wings grow from her shoulders. The mere sight of a Gorgon is enough to petrify weak beings. The Gorgon is not as versatile as the Arch Mage nor as powerful as the Oracle in magical strength.
