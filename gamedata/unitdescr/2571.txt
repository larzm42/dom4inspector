There are three Caelian Clans. The Caelians of the Raptor Clan of Raven's Vale are descendants of the Mairyas, servants of the wicked Mainyus. They are warlike and physically stronger than other Caelians. Militia are quickly levied troops with light armaments. They are rarely used in military campaigns.
