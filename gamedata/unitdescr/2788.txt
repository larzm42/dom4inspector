Born at the dawn of time the Man-Eater represents an earlier era, when monsters and giants roamed the world. The Man Eater is is a horrible, winged lion with the head of a human and the tail of a scorpion. It is the the progenitor of monsters and his offspring are known as manticores. The monster ravaged the land of men and brought destruction and strife until the previous Pantokrator rose to power and imprisoned the monster for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone the Man Eater is once more free to feast upon the flesh of men.
