The Ahuras were three celestial beings given might and splendor by a previous Pantokrator. Greatest of the three was the Lord of Wisdom, who in constant struggle with his wicked twin, the Destructive Spirit, would lead men to good deeds. Banished from this world, he has acted through his prophets and his divine messengers, the six Amesha Spentas. Now with the Pantokrator gone, he can return to the world and claim it as his own.
