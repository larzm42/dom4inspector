The Viracocha is a giant of divine heritage. He was the servant of a previous Pantokrator and aided him in the creation of the world. He was given the splendor of the sun, the rage of the storm and the life-bringing rain as tools and was commanded to bring civilization and order to creation. But the splendor of the sun gave the Viracocha hubris and he tried to create men to inhabit the world. He breathed air into stones and created a race of giants. But the stone giants were imbecilic and violent and they threatened other races created by the Pantokrator. The Pantokrator was displeased and took the rain from his servant and drowned the giants with a great flood. The Viracocha was imprisoned for eternity. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the Viracocha can return and bring splendor to the world and claim it as his.
