The Chak Muuch, red toads, are a strange brood of Muuch that were hatched in a sacred Cenote near a flooded Zotz ruin. The Chak Muuch have highly poisonous black and red skin. Their skin was considered a sign and a blessing from the awakening god and they were given sacred status. The Chak Muuch are now trained by the Muuch K'uhul as sacred warriors and assassins. The Chak Muuch applies the poison of their skin to their darts and weapons.
