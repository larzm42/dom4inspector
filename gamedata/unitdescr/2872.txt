Axieros is one of the few surviving Meliai of Therodos. She and her three sisters took a special interest in the human population of the Telkhine kingdom. They encouraged humans to pursue the arts of her daktyloi brothers, and they taught the humans sailing and ship building. She and her sisters became known as the Kabeirides, mothers of the Kabeiroi craftsmen. When Therodos fell Axieros fled to the lands of Arcoscephale where she joined a temple and became a priestess of remarkable skills. Her magical powers rival the Therodian Hekaterides and her martial prowess as well as strategic abilities are indisputable.
