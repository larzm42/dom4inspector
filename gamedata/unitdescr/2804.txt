Ichtyids are a race of fishmen that dwell along the coastlines, both in the water and on land. They are born in shallow waters and use turtles as both food and material for weapons and armor. Ichtyids are quite stupid, but a few of them have somehow gained magic powers from the sea. These rare fishmen gain respect and status as spiritual leaders of their tribes.
