Born at the dawn of time the Myrmecoleon represents an earlier era, when monsters and giants roamed the world. It is a strange being of two conflicting natures, those of a great lion and a monstrous ant. It is plagued by a ravenous hunger and a foul mood, as the ant part of the monster is unable to digest what the lion part devours. Thus the beast is always hungry and always furious. When the previous Pantokrator rose to power he imprisoned and banished all that threatened his creation. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the raging Ant Lion will once more try to satisfy his hunger.
