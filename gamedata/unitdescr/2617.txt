The six great Daevas are divine demons and emanations of the Destructive Spirit. Each Daeva of the Heptad represents an aspect of their Lord, opposed to the Amesha Spentas of the Lord of Wisdom. Zauri is the Daeva of Aging and the bane of plants. She is opposed to Ameretat, Spenta of Plants and principle of immortality. The presence of Zauri will cause plants to wither and people to age and die.
