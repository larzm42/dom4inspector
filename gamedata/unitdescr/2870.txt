Since the first contacts with Therodos the mermen of Pelagia have been fascinated with the secrets of the Closed Realm, the Pelagian name for dry land. Explorers of the closed realm arrived with remarkable secrets and hidden lore. With time mystics of the closed realm initiated priests and soldiers in the secrets of the closed realm. A religious order formed, bent on spreading the glory of the awakening god into the closed realm. At first several closed realm telesteria were built, but suspicion among the Pearl Mages of an impending mermen rebellion resulted in a decree that all Closed Realm shrines were to close. Some Closed Realm Champions would not abandon their cause and their telesteria. They found themselves declared heretic by the triton rulers, but their services are still used by the generals of the Closed Realm, unknown to the triton rulers. Apostates of the CLosed Realm can only be recruited where there is a temple.
