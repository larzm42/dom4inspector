Born at the dawn of time the Celestial Lion represents an earlier era, when monsters and giants roamed the world. It was given divine might and authority by a previous Pantokrator and served as a guardian spirit of the kings beneath the sun and the stellar bodies. Now with the Pantokrator gone it has realized the aspirations of the other Pretenders and will protect its subjects by donning the mantle of God itself.
