There are three clans of Caelians. The Caelians of Spire Horn Mountain trace their lineage from the Kavi heroes of old. The Kavi were blessed by the Mainyus of the sky and their descendants are more closely attuned to the wind and the storms than other Caelians. They have partial resistance to cold and lightning. Many of the Spire Horn Caelians use bows, but the warriors of the clan are remarkably skilled fliers and they are known to swoop down and attack unsuspecting armies during raging storms. The Spire Horn Warriors use armor studded with bronze, a metal closely attuned to thunder. They wield magical ice lances crafted by the Airya clan that are capable of harming ethereal beings.
