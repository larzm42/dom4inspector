Born at the dawn of time the Demon Macaw represents an earlier era, when monsters and giants roamed the world. Gifted with brilliant splendor the monstrous bird became envious of the Sun and the Moon and chased them away from the skies. With the Sun and the Moon gone he impersonated the stellar entities himself and basked in the worship of mankind. Furious with the breach of his intended order the Pantokrator imprisoned the Demon Macaw for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the monster bird is breaking free from his prison and is once more worshiped as the Sun and the Moon.
