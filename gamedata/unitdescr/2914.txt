Before the first contacts with the tuatha the Merrow practiced their own ancient form of druidism. With increasing influence from the tuatha their focus changed, but the Ysian Druids were never able to master the tuathan secrets. While the most powerful mages in the queendom is undisputedly the Morgen Queens, there are still several Merrow of considerable magic skills. The Merrow Druids once served as priests, but now they have lost most of their religious influence. They are still revered as keepers of traditions, but they no longer wield priestly powers.
