Skilled Spire Horn warriors are rewarded with status as Tempest Warriors. They are specially trained to be able to fly even during heavy storms. Their training and armor give them increased resistance to lightning. They do not wear ice armor, but they use ice lances, magical weapons capable of hurting ethereal beings.
