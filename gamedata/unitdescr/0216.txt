The Dragon is an ancient reptile of tremendous physical and magical power. Born before the history of time, the dragons were perceived as threats to the world and imprisoned by the previous Pantokrator millennia ago. Dragons are enormous, scaly, winged beasts capable of breathing fire, poisonous gas or supernatural frost upon enemies. Dragons are closely attuned to the magic that brought them into life and thus focus mainly on one magic path. The physical bodies of Dragons are not well suited for spell casting. Red Dragons have their skills reduced when casting spells from paths other than Fire. Therefore, Dragons tend to adopt human form, but when wounded, they revert to their greater Dragon form.
