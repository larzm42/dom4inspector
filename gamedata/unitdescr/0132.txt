The elites of the Caelian war machine, the Iceclads don shiny ice hauberks, wield ice blades and are protected by a transparent shield of ice known as an ice aegis. The ice armor is difficult to make and time consuming to forge. The protection gained from ice armor depends on the temperature of the province. Their ice blades are magical weapons capable of hurting ethereal beings.
