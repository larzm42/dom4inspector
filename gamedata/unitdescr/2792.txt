The Solar Serpent is a great serpent born at the dawn of time, when monsters and giants roamed the world. It is the eternal enemy of the Serpent of Chaos, another primordial monster, and was rewarded by the Pantokrator with an aura of solar splendor. During the rebellion of the lesser gods the great serpent fought against the Great Antagonist and the Serpent of Chaos. When the Antagonist was defeated he spelled a curse that banished the Pantokrator's servants and the Solar Serpent was unable to remain in creation. Now, with the waning of the old decrees, the Solar Serpent and the Serpent of Chaos are preparing to once more bring the primordial battle of light and dark to creation. Great Serpents can shed their skin and regenerate their wounds, and the Solar Serpent is no exception.
