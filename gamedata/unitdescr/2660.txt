The Mallqui, mummy bundle, is the mummified remains of an important person and his spouse. When a noble dies his wife is expected to take her life to be embalmed together with her husband's remains and kept in a tomb palace. Rich families can afford to construct entire wings for important ancestors, while poorer families only keep a room for the deceased. The Mallqui is brought forth at important events and feasts and it is not uncommon that entire halls are filled with mummy bundles sitting and dining in silence during great feasts. The embalming ritual preserves the will and spirit of the deceased and the dead are supposed to be wiser than the living. Although the Mallqui cannot speak, the Nazcan priests divine his will and aid the family to act according to the will of their ancestors. Being older and dead, and therefore wiser, the Mallqui can demand a higher stipend than he did in life. Recently some influential nobles have warned the Inca that the stipends and lands controlled by the ancestors might ruin the kingdom. The priests have protested and called it nonsense. Several of the nobles were sacrificed and their bodies were destroyed rather than being mummified. When brought into battle the Mallqui is carried by a couple of bearers paid by his stipends.
