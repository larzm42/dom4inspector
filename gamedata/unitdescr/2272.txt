When the first Sobeks emerged from the temple marsh it was evident that they too worshipped the awakening God. The Sobeks had some priests, but no organization or institutionalized cult. They soon adopted the c'tissian cult and seemed content with the state of affairs. But one day Nakhtun Eshash emerged from the marsh and it became obvious that there were Sobek priests working in the depths of the swamp. Nakhtun Eshash commands great religious authority and is the undisputed leader of the Sobeks. He is the closest thing the Sobeks has to a king and his influence is considerable, even among the c'tissian royalty.
