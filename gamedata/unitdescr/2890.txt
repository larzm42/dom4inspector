 The Lakam Ha' Warriors, wide water warriors, are Muuch Warriors of the deeper seas. Since the establishment of the first underwater colony the Muuch have emigrated to the promised land beneath the waves and adopted to the new environment. Bronze crafting under water is difficult without magical means and the Lakam Ha' Warriors have adopted the crafts and materials used by Ichtyids: stone, sharkskin and turtle shells.
