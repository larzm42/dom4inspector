Valkyries are female Vanir. They are magically as strong as the male Vanir and share the ability to fool humans with illusions. Valkyries were granted the ability to fly in ancient times by a dead god who used them as messengers of death. Valkyries still possess the power of flight and are sacred. The Valkyries of Helhalla are given magical scale mail armor by the Hangadrotts.
