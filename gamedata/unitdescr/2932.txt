The Knights of Ys are noble-born Merrow trained for battle from a young age. The Knights of Ys resemble human knights of the feudal kingdoms, but they ride shape shifting Kelpies instead of horses, and are not as heavily armored. Kelpies are able to change their shape into that of a horse and the Knights of Ys have been known to raid coastal settlements in Man and Marignon.
