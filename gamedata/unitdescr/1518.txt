The success of R'lyeh is largely due to their powers of mind control. By enslaving other peoples, they have built a slave-based society with few dissidents. Even mages and priests are coerced into servitude, although this demands more thorough mind control. Slave mages live in shallow waters and can leave the seas. Therefore, they are used as stargazers and have some training in Astral magic.
