Born at the dawn of time the Criosphinx represents an earlier era, when monsters and giants roamed the world. It has the body of a winged lion with the head of a ram. It was given divine might and authority by a previous Pantokrator and served as a guardian spirit which brought prosperity and fertility to the realms and kingdoms of man. Now with the Pantokrator gone it has realized the aspirations of the other Pretenders and will protect its subjects by donning the mantle of God itself. The Criosphinx is attuned to the powers of nature and the skies.
