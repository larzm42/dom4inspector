The Drakones are ancient many-headed reptiles of tremendous power. Born outside of this world, the Drakones were once summoned and used by a previous Pantokrator as punishment when he found his servants lacking in faith. The Drakones brought destruction upon nations and soon the very world was at risk. The Pantokrator decided to imprison the Drakones for millennia. Now with the Pantokrator gone, their shackles are weakening. Drakones are enormous, scaly beasts capable of breathing poisonous gas upon enemies. Some Arcoscephalean historians claim that they are progenitors or a primitive form of the great dragons. Drakones are wingless and do not have the ability to change shape.
