An Androdai is an Androleth created in the merging of a human host and a spawn given the sacred and mystical nutrition of the Gibodai. The parasitic spawn thus created has mind powers far surpassing those of other Androleths. The Androdai are favored of the polypal mothers and are given priestly as well as arcane training. However, their most valued ability is their shattered minds. The process of the parasitic merging somehow allows other minds to reside in the host besides the Androdais own. If brought to a Mind Lord the Aboleth can place part of itself in the Androdai body. The Androdai's body is overtaken by the Mind Lord and the resulting mind vessel can use the understanding of the Androdai as well as the astral magic of the Mind Lord. Androdai, like Androleths, rarely live more than half a dozen years.
