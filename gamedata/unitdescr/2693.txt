Born at the dawn of time the Heavenly Condor represents an earlier era, when monsters and giants roamed the world. When the previous Pantokrator rose to power he imprisoned and banished all that threatened his creation and the heavenly bird was bound to a cloud-covered mountain. When the Nazcan people found his lofty abode they began to worship the heavenly bird. With the Pantokrator gone their prayers have been answered and the Condor from the dawn of time will return in fury.
