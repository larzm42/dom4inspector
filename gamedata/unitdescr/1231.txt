The Drakaina was once a Titaness, cursed by a Pretender God or previous Pantokrator with a hideous form. Once beautiful beyond belief, she now appears as a woman with the lower part of a huge serpent. From the serpent grow six baying dogs that hunger for human flesh. The Drakaina is skilled in the paths of Water and Death.
