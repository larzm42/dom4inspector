Androleths are the horrible result of a parasitic merging of a polypal spawn and a human host. Human slaves are captured by the servants of the Aboleths and brought in chains to cisterns filled with murky water. Polypal spawns emerge from the water and attach themselves to the mind and body of the victims. The human hosts slowly lose their minds while their bodies thrash in unending pains. When the merging is complete the mind of the host is completely gone and the body is no longer human. The resulting composite being is called an Androleth. It has the mental strength characteristic of the Aboleth race and it can project its will on lesser beings. The parasitic merging is unnatural and few Androleths survive for more than a handful years.
