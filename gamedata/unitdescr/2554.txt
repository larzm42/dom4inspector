The Ahuras were three celestial beings given might and splendor by a previous Pantokrator. The Ahura of the Waters was given power over the life-bringing Water and was made a shepherd of creation. Now with the Pantokrator gone, he will make creation His to command. The Ahura of the Waters still commands the life-bringing Water and can draw forth gems of water power from its source. He is always guarded by living water.
