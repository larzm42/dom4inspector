The Morgen Champion is a Morvarc'h Knight with strong blood and exceptional skills. Innately skilled in the magic of the Tuatha she has become a leader among her peers and an example to all. Mounted on Morvarc'h steeds the Morgen can charge on land, gallop on the sea or dive beneath its waves. On land the Morvarc'h are even more terrifying with their flaming breath. With the arrival of the new God, all lands will come under the rule of Ys.
