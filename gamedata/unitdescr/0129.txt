There are three Caelian Clans. The Raptor Clan of Raven's Vale and the Clan of Spire Horn are both physically stronger than the High Caelians of the ice palaces. Spire Horn Caelians are less resistant to cold, but have some resistance to lightning and thunder. The Spire Horn warriors take great pride in their combat skills and the most prominent are trained as Storm Guards. Their ice lances are magical weapons capable of hurting ethereal beings.
