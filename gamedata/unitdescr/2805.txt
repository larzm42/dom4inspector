Most Ichtyids, including their shamans, are quite stupid and not very good at magic. When Pelagia first encountered the Ichtyids, they were not held in high regard. But they had a drop of deeper magic hidden beneath their unblinking eyes. Thaumas, foremost of the Pearl Kings, took them in and taught them his magic. With time the Ichtyid Pearl Mages formed their own secret society. Most of them still serve Pelagia in respect of Thaumas, but a few have left for distant shores where they found small enclaves of Ichtyids. The Ichtyid Mages have some skills in astral magic, but they never mastered the clam-cultivation of the Pelagian Pearl Mages.
