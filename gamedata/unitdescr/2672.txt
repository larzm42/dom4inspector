The Zotz were once chosen by the previous Pantokrator to guide the Sun and the Moon on their daily passage through the underworld from the west to the east. Being blind they would not covet the splendor of the celestial entities. A sacred order of guides was formed. When the order of the world was changed the guides kept their vigil and awaited the eventual return of the Sun and the Moon. The Sun Guides serve the Ah K'in sun priests and wait for the coming of the Sun. Sun Guides are elite zotz warriors armed with enchanted obsidian shard blades and armors of gold and silver, given them in ancient times. The Ah K'in priests has promised them that if the Sun were to return to the caverns of Xibalba, the Zotz would once more wield the sacred splendor of the sun and the Sun Guides and their golden armors would become blessed with divine beauty.
