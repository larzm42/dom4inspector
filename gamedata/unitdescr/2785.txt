Born at the dawn of time the Solar Eagle represents an earlier era, when monsters and giants roamed the world. When the previous Pantokrator rose to power he made the eagle a messenger and representative of the Sun and gave it vast powers. But the divine eagle was filled with hubris and claimed to be Lord of all underneath the Sun. The Pantokrator punished the great bird with eternal imprisonment. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the shackles of the Solar Eagle are weakening and he will once more be free to claim the world as his. The Solar Eagle is surrounded by an aura of solar brilliance given him by the Pantokrator as a messenger of the Sun. The Solar Eagle is able to rise up to the heavens and burn away old age, sickness and old wounds.
