Born at the dawn of time the One Jaguar represents an earlier era, when monsters and giants roamed the world. It was once worshipped as a manifestation of the wrathful sun and the hunger of the wild. His fury and might are unrivaled. When the Pantokrator ordered the world he would remove all threats to his creation and the One Jaguar was imprisoned to make room for mankind. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the Hun Balam can return to the world to once more feed on the flesh of men and listen to their prayers. The Hun Balam is the first jaguar and is accompanied by his kin in battles.
