The Tempest Lords are the commanders of the Tempest Warriors, elite Spire Horn Warriors specially trained to be able to fly even during heavy storms. Their training and armor give them increased resistance to lightning. They do not wear ice armor, but they use ice blades, magical weapons capable of hurting ethereal beings.
