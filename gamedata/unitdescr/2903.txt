The Merrow are a strange breed of merfolk that resemble ugly, fish-eyed, green-skinned men with webbed feet and green hair. Despite their hideous appearances they are quite friendly and have been known to establish trade relations with human and Fir Bolg settlements. In ancient times Tir na n'Og and Marverni traded with them. After the rise of Ker-Ys most Merrow have gathered under the wise rule of the Morgen queen, but some remote enclaves still trade with the successors of Tir na n'Og, Eriu and Man. The Merrow unaffiliated with Ker-Ys have not mastered metal-working and use weapons of stone and sharkskin. Merrow have no problems leaving the sea, but they are a bit uncomfortable walking on dry land, even in rainy weather.
