The Ayar Brothers were sons of the Lord Sun, the mightiest servant of the previous Pantokrator. Haughty, powerful and blessed by their father's splendor they rebelled against the Pantokrator and were punished by eternal imprisonment in  caves with unbreakable doors of Garnet and Gold. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the unbreakable doors of Garnet and Gold are crumbling and the mightiest one of the Ayar Brothers is breaking free to prepare the world for his fathers arrival. The Ayar has inherited his father's solar splendor and the cavernous imprisonment has made him strongly attuned to the earth. He is almost impervious to mortal weapons and as long as he is in contact with the ground his strength will be renewed.
