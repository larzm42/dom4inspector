The Apu Inti, Lord Sun, is a giant of divine heritage. When his father sinned against the Pantokrator the Apu Inti inherited the splendour of the sun in his fathers stead. He was given dominion over the Sun and everything upon which it shone. But the Inti became enamoured with the beings underneath the sun and the Huacas of the land. He sired the Ayar brothers, divine heroes unchecked by the Pantokrator. The Lord of the world, found the Inti's insolence even worse than his father's, and the Lord Sun and his siblings were imprisoned in caves with unbreakable doors of Garnet and Gold. But now, with the Pantokrator gone, the doors of Garnet and Gold are weakening and they shudder with each strike of the imprisoned Sun. When they finally shatter, the Apu Inti will reclaim a world once his.
