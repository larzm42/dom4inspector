The Morgen High Queen was the last of the tuatha sorceresses that moved to Ker-Ys when Tir na n'Og fell. With magical powers far outmatching her sisters she soon rose to power and found worthy subjects in the races that dwelled in the city of bronze and crystal. With her unrivaled magic skills, she has donned a godly mantle and taken the role of a Pretender God.
