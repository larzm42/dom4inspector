The Morgen descendants of the Tuatha are to the merrow and humans of Ys what the Tuatha and Sidhe are to the Fir Bolg and humans of Eriu, semi-divine beings endowed with mystical powers. The Morgen live in the city of Bronze and Crystal and are rarely seen by the Kernou humans. But now, with the return of the sleeping God, the Morgen have taken up the arms of the Tuatha and mounted the legendary steeds known as Morvarc'h to conquer a world once taken from them. The Morvarc'h are black sea-horses with flaming nostrils and burning manes. They are able to gallop on the sea and swim under water. They can only be ridden by their Morgen mistresses, but no one else would probably try. Morgen are descendants of the Tuatha and can use glamour to confuse enemies, but the burning manes and fiery breath of the Morvarc'h are not easily hidden. The Morvarc'h Knights are revered and sacred to the people of Ys.
