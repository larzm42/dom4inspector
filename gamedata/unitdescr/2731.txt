The Chak Muuch Obsidian Warriors are sacred Chak Muuch warriors armed with enchanted obsidian blades and obsidian cuirasses. The coral used by their atlantian ancestors doesn't grown in the flooded caves, but the caverns of Xibalba are rich in obsidian. The Bacabob, descending from the basalt kings and masters of stone-crafting, found ancient obsidian blades used by sacred Zotz warriors. They adopted and mastered the means to enchant and craft obsidian and make armors for the Muuch elites. The Chak Muuch have highly poisonous skin and they coat their weapons and armors with the poison.
