Once the Caelian peoples were under the rule of divine beings known as Yazatas and Daevas. When these lesser divinities threatened the world with their never-ending war, they were banished by the Pantokrator. With their disappearance from the world the Caelians gained independence and formed a kingdom of their own, but the memory of the 'Adorable Ones' remained. With the aid of arcane rituals, the Seraphs try to circumvent the ban and summon the divinities of old to lead the nation anew. The most powerful of these ancient divinities, the Celestial Yazatas, are servants of the Amesha Spentas and the Ahuras.
