The Harab Seraphs are the black-feathered rulers of the Raptor Clan. Since the first contacts with men and an Ermorian Augur Elder, they have become enamored with the necromantic arts. The Harab were never as skilled in Air magic as the Seraphs of Caelum and the discovery of another form of magic was seductive. The Eagle Kings warn the Harab that there are dangers involved in the breaking of traditions, but to date the new arts have only increased the strength of Caelum.
