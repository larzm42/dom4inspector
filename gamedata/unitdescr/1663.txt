The Harab Seraphs are the black-feathered rulers of the Raptor Clan. As former servants of the Daevas and wicked Mainyus they are distrusted by the Airya Caelians as possible fire-polluters. When the Eagle Kings emerged from their hiding, Harab Seraphs trained in Fire magic were hunted down and brought to Ravens' Vale where their Daenas were bound in the ashen flowers so they would not cause any harm or pollution. Since the first contacts with men and an Ermorian Augur Elder, the Harab Seraphs have become enamored with the necromantic arts and their interest in dark magic has been rekindled. The Harab were never as skilled in Air magic as the Seraphs of Caelum and the rediscovery of this old form of magic was seductive. The Eagle Kings warn the Harab that there are dangers involved in the breaking of traditions, but to date the new arts have only increased the strength of Caelum.
