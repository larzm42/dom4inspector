The High Seraphs are the highest ranking of the Seraphs. They live in the Palace of Frozen Crystal where they decide on the future of Caelum. The memory of the fall of Raven's Vale has led them to prudence and seclusion from other societies. Only recently has any contact been made with the outside world. The High Seraphs are mighty Air mages and are also skilled in the path of Water.
