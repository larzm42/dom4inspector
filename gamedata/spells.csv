14	Returning	-1	1	-1	0	-1	0	632	1	0	0	0	0	The caster creates a rift in space that sucks him through, sweeping him back to the home citadel. It is a very fast and very dangerous way of teleporting. If the caster is unlucky he might get lost in time and might return later, not all all or completely insane. The spell will not work on other planes or if the home citadel is controlled by the enemy.

79	Natural Rain	-1	1	2	0	-1	0	697	1	0	0	0	0	This spell creates a heavy rain upon the battlefield. This makes it harder to fly and the heat effects of Abysians and other hot creatures are severely reduced.

150	Banishment	7	0	8	1	-1	0	768	1	0	0	0	0	With this prayer the priest can banish a large number of undead beings or demons. The undead will take damage unless they manage to resist the banishment.	
151	Blessing	7	0	8	1	-1	0	769	1	100	0	0	0	This prayer can be use to bless the priest or a group of sacred warriors. Blessed units receive increased morale and additional powers if their god is powerful enough to claim a divine title. For example, Fire gods bless their soldiers with battle prowess and gods of Nature bless their holy warriors with berserker rage. The blessing lasts the entire battle.	
152	Sermon of Courage	7	0	8	2	-1	0	770	1	100	0	0	0	Soldiers' morale is increased with the help of this prayer.	
153	Smite Demon	7	0	8	2	-1	0	771	1	100	0	0	0	This prayer will make a divine bolt strike down from the sky and deliver massive damage to a demon who fails to resist the spell. This prayer is a great compliment to banishment as it is much more powerful against single demons.	
154	Holy Avenger	7	0	8	2	-1	0	772	1	0	0	0	0	Any harm done to the casting priest will result in a divine bolt striking in the midst of the enemy.

156	Smite	7	0	8	3	-1	0	774	1	100	0	0	0	A divine bolt will strike down from the sky and kill a heathen.	
157	Fanaticism	7	0	8	4	-1	0	775	1	0	0	0	0	This prayer has the same effect as Sermon of Courage, but it affects all friendly units on the entire battlefield.	
158	Word of Power	7	0	8	4	-1	0	776	1	100	0	0	0	The priest utters a word most holy. The target is struck by divine power and paralyzed.

160	Fire Flies	2	0	0	1	-1	0	778	6	-1	20	0	0	Six burning sparks shoot forth from the wizard's hand. The sparks have very limited armor penetration and will be ineffective against armored troops.	
161	Air Shield	1	0	1	1	-1	0	779	1	0	10	0	0	The air shield solidifies the air above the caster to protect him or her from incoming missiles.	
162	Freezing Touch	2	0	2	1	-1	0	780	1	0	10	0	0	The mage touches an enemy who will suffer from severe freezing damage, possibly even die from it. This is an effective spell because armor offers no protection against this quite potent attack. On the other hand, it might be very hard to actually touch an enemy in the heat of battle.	
163	Flying Shards	2	0	3	1	-1	0	781	2002	0	30	0	0	The caster hurls several stones towards enemy units. The shards are not very powerful, but can severely injure lightly armored units. The number of shards hurled depends on the skill of the caster.	
164	Twist Fate	1	0	4	1	-1	0	782	1	0	10	0	0	The caster changes his future fate. Twist Fate negates the first successful strike against the one protected by this spell.	
165	Hand of Dust	1	0	5	1	-1	0	783	1	0	10	0	0	The caster's left hand becomes deadly, able to turn anything it touches to ashes. The spell is limited in power but ignores armor.	
166	Sleep Touch	5	0	6	1	-1	0	784	1	0	10	0	0	By touching the target, the mage makes the target unnaturally tired.	
167	Bleed	6	0	7	1	-1	0	785	1	0	0	1	0	The Bleed spell causes blood to pour out of the victim's nose, ears and mouth. The effect is a prolonged and painful death. Magic resistance can negate the effect.	
168	Monster Boar	0	5	6	3	-1	0	786	1	0	0	10	0	The caster summons a monster boar and sends it to a distant province to ravage the land. The boar is a descendant of the monster boars sent by the Lady of the Hunt to ravage the farmlands of obnoxious peasants. The boar will cause unrest in the province until it is found and slain.	
169	Orgy	6	1	7	1	6	1	787	1	0	0	1	87	The reveler organizes a wild orgy in the woods with the sacrifice of a virgin as the climactic finale. The orgy will attract a satyr intent on uninhibited fornication. During the orgy six women will be struck by the madness of the wild, shedding all clothes and civilized manners and turning to the wild as raging maenads. The satyr will remain after the orgy to lure more women into the wild.	
170	Daughter of Typhon	0	9	6	5	5	2	788	1	0	0	30	0	The mage enters the misty swamps of Pythia to find the entrance to the underworld hidden there. Once there the mage will lure and bind the guardian of the gate to his service. The guardian is a beast of might and malice unequaled. She is the daughter of Typhon, Enemy of Gods, and Echidna, Mother of Monsters and her name is Hydra. Like her lesser kin, she has nine heads. However, her central head is blessed by her father and is immortal. Should it be cut off a new body will regrow from the stump within weeks. Hydra is sacred.

172	Sounder of Boars	0	3	6	2	-1	0	790	20	0	0	20	0	The caster, often a Gutuater, summons a sounder of Great Boars. Great Boars are almost as heavy as an ox and are sacred to the people of Marverni.	
173	Contact Boar of Carnutes	0	5	6	1	3	1	791	1	0	0	7	0	The caster summons one of the Great Boars of Carnutes. These magnificent beasts live in the depths of the sacred forest.

493	Flames from the Sky	2	9	0	5	-1	0	1111	1	0	0	35	0	With this spell, the mage hurls a maelstrom of flaming spheres towards an enemy province. The flame storm will strike an enemy army camp within the province with enormous force. Most likely, the majority of the units present in the camp will die from this powerful attack, but since the entire army is rarely gathered in one camp at a given time, only half of the target province's army can be expected to be struck by the flames.

498	Strands of Arcane Power	2	9	4	7	-1	0	1116	1	0	0	70	0	This mighty enchantment enables the caster to project his mind to many distant places at once, via strands of arcane power. While projected, the caster will only be able to sense and affect magic, but this still makes it possible to search for magic sites and enemy mages. The caster will be able to project himself into all provinces that have a friendly Dominion. Magic sites are more elusive when searching in this way and a very powerful mage is required to find those that are well hidden. Mages are usually able to stay hidden from the projected mind if they have a good magic resistance value. If an Astral mage is found, a battle of the minds will ensue. Only one will leave it with their mind intact. Other mages cannot try to retaliate, but neither do they risk losing their sanity in the process. However, they will be subjected to a minor Mind Burn attack if they are found. The enchantment lasts until the caster is killed or feebleminded or the enchantment is dispelled.

502	False Fetters	1	1	1	2	-1	0	1120	1	0	10	0	0	Illusionary fetters form around the ankles of a limited number of units.  The victims will not be able to move or fight until they have overcome the fetters' magic.

522	Stoneskin	1	2	3	1	-1	0	1140	1	0	10	0	0	The skin of the caster is transformed into a rough, stone-like hide. As a side effect the target will take additional damage from cold.

528	Immolation	1	3	0	2	-1	0	1146	1	0	20	0	0	The caster bursts into white-hot flames, badly burning everyone within range. Armor offers little protection against the flames. The spell will consume the caster if he is unprotected.	
529	Inner Sun	1	3	0	1	4	1	1147	1	0	0	1	0	This spell provides a mage a way to retaliate when attacked by undead warriors. When the mage is slain, a shower of light will shoot forth from the body and burn all undead beings in the vicinity. The Inner Sun spell is a ritual and will last until the mage is killed.	
530	Mistform	1	3	1	2	-1	0	1148	1	0	10	0	0	The mage's body becomes mist. Striking the mist that makes up the mage's body causes the mage very little damage. The mistform will end if the mage gets hit exceptionally hard or by a magical weapon.

535	Mossbody	1	3	6	1	2	1	1153	1	0	20	0	0	The caster covers the body of a small number of troops in a magical moss. The moss has a large chance of providing an extra layer of protection against any attack.

536	Luck	1	3	4	1	-1	0	1154	1	2	20	0	0	The caster changes the future fates of some soldiers close by. Those affected have a very good chance of escaping blows or magic that would otherwise have killed them. Luck does not affect undead or inanimate creatures as they are dead already.

549	Swarm	1	4	6	1	-1	0	1167	2018	0	0	1	0	The caster summons and transforms several dragonflies. The enlarged insects aren't very dangerous, but will surely disturb those they attack. If cast under water shrimps will appear instead.	
550	Body Ethereal	1	4	4	1	-1	0	1168	1	0	30	0	0	The target's body becomes hazy and transparent. The target can pass through obstacles and non-magical weapons usually just pass through his body without harming it.

556	Solar Eclipse	1	5	0	3	4	1	1174	1	0	0	1	0	The spell will blot out the sun, but only for a little while and in a limited area. It is enough to make a battlefield as dark as the night and will impair all units without darkvision.

568	Wooden Warriors	1	5	6	2	-1	0	1186	1	0	50	0	0	The mage transforms the skin of a group of soldiers into a rough protective bark. The bark offers much improved protection compared to a normal human's skin, but it won't help a thick-hided creature much.	
569	Mother Oak	1	5	6	5	-1	0	1187	1	0	0	50	0	The oldest and mightiest of all oaks in the realm is enchanted to become the greatest oak there ever was.

579	Iron Pigs	1	6	3	3	6	1	1197	7	0	0	10	0	The caster transforms seven ordinary boars into beings of flesh and steel. People do not like to be permanently transformed and would probably revolt against masters that tried to curse them with iron bodies. Pigs, on the other hand, are not bothered, or at least they don't complain. Pigs are also preferred to dogs, as they have the size and strength to trample human-sized opponents. The transformation does not make the pigs braver.	
580	Control	1	6	4	3	-1	0	1198	1	100	0	1	0	The caster alters the magical bonds of a magical being, making it serve him instead of its creator.

586	Phoenix Pyre	1	7	0	2	-1	0	1204	1	0	20	0	0	This spell gives the mage limited immortality. When the mage is slain, he will explode in a cloud of fire and reappear somewhere else on the battlefield. The spell lasts for the entire battle, no matter how many times the mage is killed. However, being killed is exhausting and the spell will not work while the mage is unconscious.

589	Liquify	1	8	2	4	-1	0	1207	1	100	20	0	103	The targets are turned into pools of liquid flesh, causing instant death. If a target resists the spell he is only partially liquified and will probably become permanently crippled.	
590	Prison of Sedna	1	7	2	3	-1	0	1208	1	100	0	1	0	The caster transforms the water surrounding the enemies into ice. The encased targets are protected from strikes, but must break free to be able to move or defend themselves. While encased they will become chilled and numbed and suffer fatigue.	
591	Sea of Ice	1	7	2	6	-1	0	1209	1	0	0	80	0	All lakes, seas and rivers in the world are frozen by this powerful enchantment.

592	Marble Warriors	1	7	3	3	-1	0	1210	1	0	0	1	0	The caster transforms the skin of his friends into a hard marble-like hide. The warriors become marble white and almost impossible to damage.

597	Creeping Doom	1	7	6	3	-1	0	1215	5055	0	0	1	0	This spell enlarges a number of insects to enormous proportions. The insects will aid the caster by attacking or at least disturb his enemies.	
598	Transformation	1	6	6	2	-1	0	1216	1	0	0	8	0	The caster is transformed into a random monster. This is not without risk, however, as the caster's mind and body may be damaged in the process.

All provinces in friendly dominion will be affected by the fata morgana. The enchantment lasts until it is dispelled or the caster dies.	
603	Quickening	1	8	2	2	-1	0	1221	1	0	0	1	0	This spells grants quickness to a large number of units. Quickness increases the speed and ability to dodge of the quickened one.

This will spread dominion to the places where false pretenders were worshiped. When a forest has the right dominion it will start to attack instead of whispering hymns.

1002	Blood Vortex	6	8	7	7	-1	0	1620	1	0	0	166	0	This horrifying ritual creates the blood vortex. A churning pool of polluted blood that roars horrible yet terribly alluring songs. The song of the vortex is heard by all mortals in the world, whispering sweet melodies of death and carnage, beckoning all people to come bask in its crimson presence. Its song is especially strongly felt by those whose blood is suitable for blood rituals, summoning them to the site of the ritual. The mortals that enter its presence stare dumbfounded on the waves and swirls in the vortex, or throw themselves heedlessly to drown in the bloody swirls. The master of the ritual then collects suitable victims to use in other rituals. Eventually, when no life is left in the world around the vortex, it dries out and dies. Provinces with strong influences of order will be less affected by the beckoning and those with strong turmoil influences will be more drawn to the vortex.	
1003	Improved Cross Breeding	6	8	7	2	6	2	1621	3034	0	0	20	0	Hundreds of different creatures from mice to humans are magically cross-bred and grown in an effort to produce a powerful monster.

1005	Blood Vengeance	6	9	7	1	-1	0	1623	1	0	0	1	0	This spell will bring the ultimate protection for a mage in battle. Whenever the mage is wounded, the damage is transferred to the one who tried to wound him. Magic resistance might prevent this from taking effect, so the mage is not fully invulnerable.

These Devils, through various threats, will try to persuade their victims to sell their souls and join in the killing of their own commander. The strength of the threats depends on the strength of the God's Dominion, but extreme courage is always required to defy the Devils.
