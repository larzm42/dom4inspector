The caster creates a rift in space that sucks him through, sweeping him back to the home citadel. It is a very fast and very dangerous way of teleporting. If the caster is unlucky he might get lost in time and might return later, not at all or completely insane. The spell will not work on other planes or if the home citadel is controlled by the enemy.
