The Huacas, 'sacred ones', were semi-divine beings of an earlier age and the ancestors of the Nazcans. Their power was broken by the previous Pantokrator and most fled to the Celestial Sphere ages ago. With the aid of arcane rituals, the Coyas try to circumvent the ban and summon the ancestral divinities to lead the nation anew. Huacas are winged angelic beings surrounded by auras of divine splendor. If the spell is cast by a mage wearing a Huaca Headdress two additional Huacas will arrive.
