The caster curses the enemy army with the weight of earth and stones. Affected enemy units are severely burdened. Moving and fighting will exhaust them and can prove disastrous even for lightly armed soldiers. The curse will last until the battle is over. Flying units will still be able to fly, but it will be very exhausting.
