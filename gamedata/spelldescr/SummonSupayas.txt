The Supaya is the ghost of a Huaca, the semi divine ancestors of the Nazcans. While their bodies decayed long before the Nazcans begun to mummify their dead, the spirits of the ancestors can still be called upon by powerful mages. The Huaca ghost has lost its divine splendor, but is still revered as a divine being. Supayas are ethereal and difficult to harm with mundane weapons. If the spell is cast by a mage wearing a Huaca Headdress two additional Huacas will arrive.
