This prayer can be use to bless the priest or a group of sacred warriors. Blessed units receive increased morale and additional powers if their god is powerful enough to claim a divine title. For example, Fire gods bless their soldiers with battle prowess and gods of Nature bless their holy warriors with berserker rage. The blessing lasts the entire battle.
