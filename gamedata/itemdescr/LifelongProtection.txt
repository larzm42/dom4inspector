The Blood mage sacrifices onescore slaves to get the attention of Infernal powers. When contact is made, he signs his name in blood upon a contract with a powerful demon. From then until the day he dies, the Blood mage will be protected in battle by a never-ending horde of imps. In return for this boon, the Blood mage will give his soul to the demon when the contract ends.
