A sceptre of silver and steel, set with tourmalines and enchanted with black magic, this sceptre was crafted by Shantanok, the ruler of the Black Coven, in the forges of the Obsidian Citadel.  The wielder of the sceptre will be able to command vast numbers of walking dead. The powers of the sceptre can only be wielded by a trained necromancer.
