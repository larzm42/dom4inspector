This short sword of black steel was quenched in the blood of lepers and the tears of plague victims upon its creation. Any wounds inflicted by this blade will become grievously infected and start to fester at a supernatural rate.  Furthermore, the bearer of the sword will become an infected carrier of an extremely virulent disease that he and anyone close to him will likely succumb to, unless undead.
