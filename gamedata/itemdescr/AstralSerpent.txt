Trapped inside this snake-shaped jade amulet is the spirit of a very poisonous serpent. Whenever the wearer of the amulet strikes at someone, the spirit will emerge and strike simultaneously. The serpent spirit ignores any armor that the enemy might be wearing and will also grant its wearer partial resistance to poison.
