This unbelievably massive armor is crafted out of black obsidian and is so heavy that it seems immovable. Indeed, were it not for the powerful spells welded into its construction, the enormous weight would render the wearer immobile. As it is, he will be able to move but only at the expense of tremendous exertion. On the other hand, he will be rendered virtually impervious to any sort of harm and the wounds upon his flesh will close at awesome speed. The wearer of this massive armor will also be almost impervious to fear.
